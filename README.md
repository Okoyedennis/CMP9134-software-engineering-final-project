## 📖 Overview

The Ground Control Station allows users to interact with a virtual robot in real time.

Users can:

- monitor robot status
- send movement commands
- reset the robot
- view environment maps
- inspect sensor readings
- review mission logs

The system is split into:

- **Frontend** → dashboard and UI
- **Backend** → authentication, logging, API integration
- **Robot Simulator** → provides robot data

---

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 1. Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Okoyedennis/CMP9134-final-project
cd CMP9134-final-project
```

---

### 2. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

Docker Desktop
Git

---

### 3. Docker setup

This project runs using Docker Compose and includes:

- Frontend container
- Backend container
- Virtual Robot Simulator container

The backend connects to:

- MongoDB Atlas for database storage
- Robot Simulator through Docker networking

---

### 4. Environment configuration

The required environment values are already defined in docker-compose.yml.

Backend environment includes:

```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=""
JWT_SECRET=dennis_super_secret_key
ROBOT_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Frontend environment includes:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_ROBOT_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_TELEMETRY_WS_URL= ws://localhost:5001
```

---

### 5. Run the application with Docker

Build and start all services:

- docker compose up --build

To run in detached mode:

- docker compose up --build -d

To stop the services:

- docker compose down

---

### 6. Application URLs

Once the containers are running, the application will be available at:

- Frontend: http://localhost:2000
- Backend: http://localhost:3000
- Robot API Docs: http://localhost:5001/docs

### 7. Notes on Docker networking

The backend connects to the robot simulator using the Docker service name:

http://robot-api:5000

The browser/frontend connects to the robot simulator WebSocket using the host-mapped port:

ws://localhost:5001/ws/telemetry
